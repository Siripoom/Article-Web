            <p>Flask is a web application framework written in Python. It was developed by Armin Ronacher, who led a
                team of international Python enthusiasts called Poocco. Flask is based on the Werkzeg WSGI toolkit and
                the Jinja2 template engine.Both are Pocco projects.

                Flask is often referred to as a microframework. It is designed to keep the core of the application
                simple and scalable.

                Instead of an abstraction layer for database support, Flask supports extensions to add such capabilities
                to the application.

            <h2>Why is Flask a good web framework choice?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Unlike the Django framework, Flask is very Pythonic. It’s easy to get started with Flask, because it
                doesn’t have a huge learning curve.

                On top of that it’s very explicit, which increases readability. To create the “Hello World” app, you
                only need a few lines of code.

                This is a boilerplate code example.
