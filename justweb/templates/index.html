                    the Jinja2 template engine.Both are Pocco projects.

                    Flask is often referred to as a microframework. It is designed to keep the core of the
                    application
                    simple and scalable.

                    Instead of an abstraction layer for database support, Flask supports extensions to add such
                    capabilities
                    to the application.

                <p>Unlike the Django framework, Flask is very Pythonic. It’s easy to get started with Flask, because
                    it
                    doesn’t have a huge learning curve.

                    On top of that it’s very explicit, which increases readability. To create the “Hello World” app,
                    you
                    only need a few lines of code.

                    This is a boilerplate code example.
